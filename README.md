Data Visualization Backend Designer (WIP)

Backend Designer which takes a dataset directory, allows the user to select a column of data, and run plots based on the data.

Issues:
1. Directory Selection: could have directory in window instead of command-line, could have the ability to access file explorer.
2. Column Selection: could have multiple based in tkinter window (as either command-line or option menu)
3. Plot Labels can be added
4. Pie Chart lacking functionality (particularly regarding color change)
5. Color selection missing in Boxplot
6. The amount of possible selection in the Color Selection Window is only limited to 0% blue and 100% blue. The color canvases are designed using basic code automation with Java
7. GreyScale color selection option missing

And much more.

# Note that there is only one developer: changes take time.
